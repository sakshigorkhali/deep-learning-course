    "Deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, enabling significant advancements in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In this tutorial, we'll embark on our deep learning journey by learning how to design and build a deep learning model using Keras, a user-friendly and high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow. Keras allows for easy and fast prototyping of deep learning models.\n",
