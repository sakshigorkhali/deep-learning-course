Course Title: Deep Learning with Python: Foundations
Instructor: Frederick Nwanganga

Dataset used: 
MNIST dataset that consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. Each pixel is 28*28 pixels. The dataset is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

Goal:
Develop a model that learns to correctly identify handwritten digit given the image.
